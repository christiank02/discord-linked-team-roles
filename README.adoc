= Discord Bot

This repository contains the source code for a Discord bot developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework and Maven for dependency management. The bot utilizes the JDA (Java Discord API) to interact with Discord's API. It features a variety of commands, including role management and metadata registration. The bot also interacts with a SQL database to manage linked roles.

== Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

=== Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- A SQL database

=== Installing

1. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/christiank02/discordbot.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory with `cd discordbot`
3. Build the project using Maven with `mvn clean install`
4. Configure your database connection and other settings in `application.properties`. If you are developing, it's recommended to use a `dev.properties` file. You can set the `spring.profiles.active` property to `dev` in `application.properties` to use this file. Remember to ensure that your `dev.properties` file is not tracked by Git to avoid committing sensitive information.
5. Run the project with `mvn spring-boot:run`. If you have set the `spring.profiles.active` property to `dev`, Maven will use the settings from your `dev.properties` file.

== Usage

Once the bot is running, it can be invited to a Discord server. To do this, you will need to create a bot user on the Discord Developer Portal, get the bot token, and add it to your server.

The bot will respond to commands once it's in your server. For a list of available commands, navigate to your server settings in Discord. From there, select 'Integrations', then 'Bots', and find your bot in the list. Click on it to see the bot's settings and a list of available commands.

Remember to ensure that the bot has the necessary permissions to perform its tasks in your server.
